    <br>

        <article class="text">Its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 powers a number of premium Volkswagen Group products, 
        with the RS6-specific tune pumping out 591 horsepower.
        <br>
        <br>
        The RS6 is down on output and torque on its chief rival, though. 
        Getting the most of the RS6 means playing with the drive modes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        There are the usual suspects: 
        <br>
        <ol >
        <li class="listext">Comfort</li>
        
        <li class="listext">Auto</li>
        
        <li class="listext">Dynamic</li>


        </ol>
        <br>
       
           But the RS6 adds a pair of customizable drive modes, programmable via the 
           MMI system and activatable via a pair of buttons on the steering wheel. Audi's approach mirrors BMW's and it works just as well,
           giving owners the ability to preload settings and quickly adjust on the fly.
        
        <br>
        <br>
        Those specific tweaks include adjustments to the air suspension, the torque-vectoring differential, and the steering.
        Set everything to Dynamic, and the RS6 disguises its 5,000-pound curb weight with ease. This is a sharp, agile handler, 
        thanks in no small part to the same excellent air suspension that makes the big wagon so darn comfortable. Shared with the A6 Allroad,
        the RS6's air springs are 50 percent stiffer. 
       <br>
       <br>
        The RS6's available carbon-ceramic brakes are a pricey proposition (£7,000) and really not all that necessary,
        although they are a prerequisite for the 190-mph top speed. The automaker limits cars like my tester, with its standard steel 
        rotors (16.5 inches in front and 14.6 in back), to go 155. Pity the loss of top speed, but don't pity these brakes. They're still immensely powerful, 
        using eight-piston front calipers to bring the big wagon to a halt. The pedal feels confident under repeated hard braking maneuvers, reinforcing our 
        position that only a certain type of owner needs the upgrade option.
       <br>
       <br>
        Despite all of this goodness, though, the RS6 Avant feels aloof. In many ways, it's like the Nissan GT-R-ultra-competent, 
        but getting to know and bond with the car is a struggle. It feels like there are always layers to its abilities that you, with your fists of ham, 
        understanding of consequences, and healthy fear of traffic cops, will never be able to <b>ACCESS</b>.
